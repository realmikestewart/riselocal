#### Most Common Questions
Q) What is Paid Search Marketing?
A) PPC stands for pay-per-click, a model of internet marketing in which advertisers pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked. Essentially, it's a way of buying visits to your site, rather than attempting to “earn” those visits organically. Search engine advertising is one of the most popular forms of PPC and other forms include paid social media amplification and retargeting ads.

Q) Why Do I Need Paid Search?
A) Paid search is great for quick wins in local search. PPC will give you a reliable flow of traffic for a predicable amount of money. The only way to get traffic to your website for a new keyword quickly is to pay for it. One of the biggest benefits of paid search is that you get real time data on what works and what doesn't work. So making changes to your keywords, website conversion funnel, and content based on real data helps your organic rankings and overall results from your online presence.

Q) Where Will My Business Show Up and When?
A) PPC ads show up at the top of the search engine results page above all other advertisers. When you combine PPC with organic and local search results the increased share of voice and real estate you take up has a big impact on your business visibility and conversions. Controlling when you show up and when you don't is very important to preventing ad waste. When a campaign is built properly it will compliment your business resources, budget constraints, and business operations. We can pause and start your campaign as needed.

Q) Broad, Modified Broad, Phrase, and Exact Match-- What Does It All Mean?
A) In the world of pay-per-click advertising, a keyword can have many different variations. These variations are called "match types." Each has a specific use and helps savvy paid search marketers improve performance of campaigns by focusing on the intent of the searcher. Broad Match is just that, broadly matching queries text in any order. Broad Match can also match synonyms. It is great when volume is a focus, otherwise we recommend avoiding it.  Modified Broad Match simply prevents the search engine from using synonyms. Phrase match is just that, matching words together in a phrase with possible words before and after. Exact match is only the exact keywords desired to show up for in the same order of appearance. It is the version that restricts the results the most. 

Q) How Long Does It Take for PPC to Work?
A) To build a paid search campaign it usually takes between 48 hours and as much as a week. The timeframe to complete a campaign build depends on whether a campaign exists that needs to be improved or if a new campaign needs to be built. Factors that determine the time also include setting up analytics, call tracking, and retargeting creative banners. We can get started on improving or launching your paid search campaigns today!

#### Most Common Questions
Q) What Does Good Hosting Matter?
A) Good web hosting means your website doesn't come down from the internet. Most business owners buy hosting because of convenience or price. There is an unseen force behind your precious online assets. Like electrical power, the temptation is to take hosting for granted, but the lights don't always come back on when you flip the switch after an outage.
When considering hosting we recommend focusing on security, maintenance, uptime, bandwith, site load speed and most importantly things like technical expertise and customer service. If the people answering the phone don't have access to restore or change your service you have a problem. 

Q) Why is Site Speed So Important?
A) Site speed not only affects conversions, but even serves as a factor that Google may use to rank your site higher than your competitors. Page speed is only one of many algorithmic factors and affects rankings queries. 

Q) Where Will My Website be Hosted?
A) Hosting your site locally has significant advantages to your online presence. The geolocation of your website is an important factor in web hosting as shorter distances contribute to faster speeds. Although there are numerous factors, the geographic location of the data center is one of the most significant factors that will affect how fast your website is transferred to the visitor’s computer. When visitors are located geographically closer to your hosting company’s data center, your website will load faster.

Q) What is the difference between Hostgator/Godaddy and Rise Local hosting?
A) The worst thing hosting provider can do is change your IP without notice. The next thing they do that is really troublesome is that they can take 32 hours to reboot a server. Customer service people have no authority and can't fix anything without escalation to a different department. Another thing that concerns us about cheap web hosts is they do not do anything to improve the files that are on the server. When we migrate a site we compress images, minimize java script and focus on TTFB (time to first byte) and loadspeed. All these things are not considered by your standard cheap web hosting providers. Lastly, we have control. Having control means you can optimize code and content quickly. That means alot to your business. 

Q) How Long Does It Take to Migrate My Site?
A) Migrations take 3-5 days to complete once the request is submitted. Please make sure you have all your proper credentials. It takes more time to get proper access in many occasions than it does to prepare your site for migration.
