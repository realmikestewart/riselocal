+++ The Changing Role of a Webmaster

When I first began my career in local search marketing in 2000 less than 10% of people used the internet to find a local business. Today in 2016 the number is over 92% and the print business is less than 8%. Yet today most businesses build a website the same way as they did in 2005. When I speak at conferences I jokingly say that websites used to be built like mushrooms, you feed them shit leave them in the dark and watch them grow. Today we don't build websites like that. Having a single person build your website is a flawed approach. I will explain how the role of a webmaster has changed over the years.

There are two paths to building a great website: you either start with the layout and design or the content and data. I have always preferred a content driven development path and put a huge focus on collaborating with the client to ideate new content and to gather and port existing content to be properly structured. Once you have the inventory of content is it much easier to plan the website.

In the past a typical website project would require 40 to 80 hours of time to develop. Much of that time is spent getting to the point of being able to do the work. We built tools to speed this up from 6 hours to literally seconds. Most websites touch five separate hands: The first is a project coordinator who understands the business, objectives, and goals from the businesses perspective. The second is a designer who understands art and computer aided design concepts, such as grid layout and user experience. The next hands your site touches is a developer who understands the latest programming code. This is one of the areas of web development that has changed the most. Hard coding websites and a reliance on broken or borrowed code is causing challenges for website maintenance, updates, and puts a reliance on keeping unskilled developers employed. The next hands your website will touch is a quality assurance expert to test for flaws. This can sometimes be your developer or webmaster but it's better to have a second set of eyes, like proofreading. The final role is a marketing expert who understands online promotion and your business objectives.  

The problem with the approach above is that it doesn't put the hands on your website in the proper order. This is the mushroom website development process of leaving it in the dark and feeding it shit. Standardizing website development by focusing on marketing and SEO before the website is complete has a significant impact on whether the site converts visitors and ranks for keywords.

Future Web Developers Need to Focus On
Lower gross margins, the pricing strategy for websites must change too. Billable hours is not how websites are built these days. More result-driven, value based pricing is becoming the standard, but that too will be disrupted by website build automation and iterative and collaborative website process development

Future development will not be using today's methods, WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla will be disrupted by more efficient website frameworks and applications using scalable components such as bootstrap, underscores, bones and even static websites.

smaller target markets
Future website firm's will need simpler products and services
agencies don't desire to brace the unknown
bold in actions
traditional agencies are slow to adapt and will family
industry experts are no longer relevent 
innovators who are not are going to become the future leaders in web technology
