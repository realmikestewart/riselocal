Your logo is the cornerstone of your brand. The design, typography, and color scheme are shape the viewer's first impressions about your company. But how do you managing the actual files? A great logo in the wrong format kills your marketing momentum. Here is what every owner needs to know about logo files.
<!--more-->

Many business owners are disappointed to find out they don't have the original logo files. In most cases what they have is the "photo" instead the "negative" used to create the image. Designers, especially those working for marketing agencies, love to hold onto the source files because they know that you need the those files to produce your logo in any other format than what you original asked.

The typical example is you ask a for a logo for the website. The designer creates the design as a vector or layered file that you never see. What gets delivered to you is a jpg or png for your website.  A few months later, you decide to print new business cards.  The folks producing the file tell you the logo file you sent them is no good. They need to create the image in a new format. Why? Because the original artist didn't give you the source files!

Marketing agencies do this on purpose. Since they hold on to the file they know you will call them. That gives them another opportunity to sell you on thier services.

## How to get your Master files
Knowing what to ask for may be enough to get the original designer to turn over the files. The exact type of file you need depends on the software used to create the original image. However, if you specifically the designer to turn over the vector or layered master file used to create the original image you will sound really smart and they will know exactly what to send. If they no longer have the files then it has to be recreated. I'm sure they would happy to give you a quote for that.....  Ugh!

### Okay, I have the Master... Now What?
Assuming they did a professional job building the master file, you now have everything you need to output your logo in higher resolutions and different backgrounds.

You will need several logo variations to support your print, local, social, and search campaigns.  It's impossible to predict ALL the files you are going to need, but a few simple guidelines will get you off to a really good start.

### SVG for Web and Email
SVG is a newer image format used on websites and HTML emails. What makes SVGs special is that they load fast at any size! Regardless how big you scale and SVG image the file size NEVER changes. SVG logos can also be placed on any background, including transparent backgrounds! It is even possible to annimate SVG files!

### Standard PNG And JPG Images for Profiles
PNGs and JPGs are probably what you are used to seeing. These are the type of image files you load into your profile settings. Quickbooks, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, etc. all have different requirements for looking your best. If your file doesn't meet those guidelines your logo may look squished or stretched. It may be flat out rejected if the resolution or file is too big.

### Black and White
Most logos don't look good if they are printed or photocopied in black and white. In most cases its because the logo file you are is on background that won't work in black and white. In other cases it because in black in with their isn't enough contrast to bring out the fine detail in your logo. Whatever the reason, it's good practice to produce B&W variations for every color variation produced.

### Favicon
You may have noticed those snazzy little icons in your browser tab. They are called favicons! Every browser has a different optimal format. The good news is that after you build the favicon design its easy to generate it into all the types you need.

A highly skilled graphic artist knows you need these things, so you shouldn't have to ask for them. Sadly, very few take the time and effort to put it all together in a package like we have, so if you getting the runaround consider our [logo design services]('service/identity/logo-design/').
