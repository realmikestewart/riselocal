Your logo is the cornerstone of your brand. It's design, typography, and color scheme are what shape the viewer's first impressions about your company. But what about the actual logo files? If your logo isn't produce the the right way in the correct format you will struggle to produce the logo variations you need for print materials, signage, social media profiles, and more. This quick overview lays out everything you need to know to avoid common mistakes.

The biggest problem business owners have with logo is getting the source files. To use a photography analogy, what most graphic designers do is give you the photo and keep the negative. By keeping the negative the graphic designer knows that you will eventually have to call them back when you need new media produced.

Unfortunately graphic designers aren't alway organized. By the time you call them back they may have changed jobs, changed computers, or simply deleted the files to reclaim disk space.

That's when you get the bad news. Recreating the logo in the format you need is going to cost a lot more than the original image!

## How to get your Master files
Of course, the way to avoid this mess is to insist the logo designer turn over the source files when you order the work. If you don't do that your only other option is to ask nicely. In this scenario knowing what to ask for will probably work to your advantage.

The exact type of file you need depends largerly on the logo style and software used to create the image. However, if you ask designer to turn over the vector or layered master file used to create the original art work you will sound really smart and they will know exactly what you want. Here is the range of responses you are likely to get.

-   I don't have it anymore, but I can recreate it for $$$.
-   Sure. That will be $$$ to turn over that file.
-   You don't need that. I can get that done for you for $.
-   What are you talking about? I gave you the original image.

If you here those responses you can be confident they KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED, but are trying to stay in the loop for future work. These people SHOULD have submitted the files without you having to ask for them instead of making you ask. Furthermore, if they really don't have the files or don't know what you are talking about then you know they are not as skilled as you thought.

To be fair, if you worked directly with a developer they may be reasonable in thinking you didn't have the software or knowledge to use the file, and had a reasonable expectation that you would call them anyway when you have additional needs. It might be wise to cut those graphic developers some slack.

If on the other hand you had an agency do the work show no mercy because they know better. Not only did they charge you a fortune to produce the original image, but now they are trying to use their leverage to wrestele even more fees out of you?

Rest assured people that play that way are NOT looking out for your best interest.

## Okay, I have the Master... Now What?
Okay, you threw down the gauntlet and got your master logo files. Good job. Now what? Unfortunately, you are making progress, but not out of the woods yet.

There are a LOT of logo developers out there using poor design techniques. In many cases these shortccuts get you completely unusable file in the right format. But lets go ahead and assume now that your graphic designer actually produced a unique work of art that you like in the correct format, and that you are indeed the sole legal owner of that work. Now what?

Congratulations. You are finally ready to produce what you need for your print identity, marketing collateral, social media profiles, website and more. It would be impossible to predict ALL the way your company will use your logo, but these simple guidelines will get you off to a really good start.

### Advice for PNG, JPG, and GIFs

#### PNG
PNG is among the newer image formats that support transparent backgrounds. The format's image size to quality ratio makes them the optimial choice for most social media profiles.

#### JPG
JPGs pack a higher resolution into smaller file, but they don't support transparent backgrounds. If your logo won't work on a transparent background anyway then high resolution JPGs are probably your best choice.

### GIF
GIF is an older image format that support transparent backgrounds. They are your only choice if PNG isn't supported and you need a transparent background. On a side note, a few sites still accept animated Gifs, but if dancing logos with flashing backgrounds sounds like a good idea to you it is my official duty to ban you from the Internet.

### SVG
SVG is a newer image format used on websites and HTML emails. What makes SVGs special is that they load fast at any size! Regardless how big you scale and SVG image the file size NEVER changes. SVG logos can also be placed on any background, including transparent backgrounds! It is even possible to annimate SVG files!

### Favicon
You may have noticed those snazzy little icons in your browser tab. They are called favicons! Every browser has a different optimal format. The good news is that after you build the favicon design its easy to generate it into all the types you need.

### BMP and TIFF
These files formats offer high resolution with no compromise. Software that prints your logo on things like envelops, letterhead and invoices will often accept BMP or TIFF files. In some cases, embroiderers and commercial printers will shave thier prep fees if you provide them with a production ready

### Black and White
Most logos don't look good if they are printed or photocopied in black and white. In most cases its because the logo file you are is on background that won't work in black and white. In other cases it because in black in with their isn't enough contrast to bring out the fine detail in your logo. Whatever the reason, it's good practice to produce B&W variations for every color variation produced.

A highly skilled graphic artist knows you need these things, so you shouldn't have to ask for them. Sadly, very few take the time and effort to put it all together in a package like we have, so if you getting the runaround consider our [logo design services]('service/identity/logo-design/').
