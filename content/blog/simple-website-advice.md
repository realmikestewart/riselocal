+++ Simple Website Advice

Do you remember when people would visit the family doctor if they felt anything wrong? The doctor essentially was a jack of all trades in the medical field. Their advice was end all, be all.

In fact there are even sub-specialties of the neurology specialty. There is practically a specialist for everything.

Way, way back in 1995 there was the "IT guy."" He knew IT, software, and simple websites. He was so smart and everyone in the company looked up to him/her. Now days we get called IT geeks, but that is dead wrong. Just because we work on the internet, doesn't mean we should know how to fix computers. Sure we know how to use them better than most, but doesn't mean we want to do open heart surgery on our neighbors DELL. Sure, I probably know more than most, but don't call me to fix your computer.

They are different processes and platforms for each and having extensive knowledge of what works real time takes a professional.

Imagine creating a site that doesn't speak to the right audience. If you simply double your call-to-action response rates (calls, emails, forms, and visits) on the site with a small investment into correcting the user experience and improving the funnel path along the site will yield huge dividends quickly. The fact is that most people buy advertising traffic without focusing on conversions first. Just like people begin building an online identity without having the right information technology tools in place, like domain email, quality hosting, and a good way to manage content and versions of content.
