A local campaign generates phone calls and leads without ad spend, but they take time to fully implement. The sooner we get started the better.

Local visibility is a major factor in your organic rankings and paid search results. These campaigns take time to produce results, but since they are major factor in your overall success it is always the first campaign you will want to launch.

 The beautiful thing about local search is that it easy to get started. You don't even need a website. All you need is Business Name, Address, and Phone number to get started. Of course, the more complete you profile the better, but there is plenty of time to optimize listings throughout the campaign. The priority now is to submit, claim, and verify listings.

 Our local search campaign are very extensive. We begin with the big data aggregators, extend to the local directories, and optimize your profiles on all the major search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yelp, and more. We spent a lot of time and money building tools and workflow so we can track our progress and success, but it takes time. The sooner we get started the better.
