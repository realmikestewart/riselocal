Now that we have verified your domain ownership and control, web hosting is the next step. Your web host is a critical, yet often overlooked, factor in your company's online marketing success. That is why we will migrate your existing site to our servers for free.

Migrating your site has three main benefits. First, we are moving your website to our rock solid infrastructure optimized for local business owners service and support needs. Second, during the migration we get real familiar with the condition of your current website. In most cases we find overlooked technical and content issues effecting your organic search results. Third, once you are on our servers we can run the diagnostic and analytic tools that help us quickly identify your areas of greatest needs.

Rise Local believes that nothing really happens in discovery meetings. We can diagnose and improve your situation a lot faster if we migrate your current website to our server.
