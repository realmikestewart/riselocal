## PPC Management Overview:
For over 15 years Rise Local's founders have been providing PPC Management to small and medium-sized businesses saving them from wasting precious advertising dollars to clicks that don't turn into customers.

We’ve built the best platform and tools that help us do one thing and one thing really well when it comes to paid search and that is build a better campaign architecture and make the campaign perform to the businesses goals and resources. We understand just how important your PPC investment and results are to your bottom line. This is exactly why we focus on PPC and making the website attract, engage, and convert like nobody else.

The problem with agencies that only do paid search is that they fail at improving what really matters, the user experience on the website. If your PPC people don't know how to create custom landing pages, proper SEO, and good content and design they are only doing 1/2 of the job. Many times they also add on website development and conversion but it is never the main focus or a skill that they have enough experience in to make a significant improvement to your customers user experience after the click to your website. Don't make this mistake.

#### Most Common Questions
Q) What is Paid Search Marketing?
A) PPC stands for pay-per-click, a model of internet marketing in which advertisers pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked. Essentially, it's a way of buying visits to your site, rather than attempting to “earn” those visits organically. Search engine advertising is one of the most popular forms of PPC and other forms include paid social media amplification and retargeting ads.

Q) Why Do I Need Paid Search?
A) Paid search is great for quick wins in local search. PPC will give you a reliable flow of traffic for a predicable amount of money. The only way to get traffic to your website for a new keyword quickly is to pay for it. One of the biggest benefits of paid search is that you get real time data on what works and what doesn't work. So making changes to your keywords, website conversion funnel, and content based on real data helps your organic rankings and overall results from your online presence.

Q) Where Will My Business Show Up and When?
A) PPC ads show up at the top of the search engine results page above all other advertisers. When you combine PPC with organic and local search results the increased share of voice and real estate you take up has a big impact on your business visibility and conversions. Controlling when you show up and when you don't is very important to preventing ad waste. When a campaign is built properly it will compliment your business resources, budget constraints, and business operations. We can pause and start your campaign as needed.

Q) Broad, Modified Broad, Phrase, and Exact Match-- What Does It All Mean?
A) In the world of pay-per-click advertising, a keyword can have many different variations. These variations are called "match types." Each has a specific use and helps savvy paid search marketers improve performance of campaigns by focusing on the intent of the searcher. Broad Match is just that, broadly matching queries text in any order. Broad Match can also match synonyms. It is great when volume is a focus, otherwise we recommend avoiding it.  Modified Broad Match simply prevents the search engine from using synonyms. Phrase match is just that, matching words together in a phrase with possible words before and after. Exact match is only the exact keywords desired to show up for in the same order of appearance. It is the version that restricts the results the most.

Q) How Long Does It Take for PPC to Work?
A) To build a paid search campaign it usually takes between 48 hours and as much as a week. The timeframe to complete a campaign build depends on whether a campaign exists that needs to be improved or if a new campaign needs to be built. Factors that determine the time also include setting up analytics, call tracking, and retargeting creative banners. We can get started on improving or launching your paid search campaigns today!
