## Local Search Marketing Campaign:
Rise Local founders and principals are highly experienced, passionately enthusiastic about local search. We began fixing local visibility for our clients back before everyone had a website and the most popular media for local searches was the yellow pages, around the year 2000. We have been developing solutions and processes that focus on how data feeds the local search ecosystem before it existed. Making sure business listings are accurate, up to date and complete is a real tasks businesses need done to get business. For many of our customers they have had agencies attempt to do it or staff members may have even been assigned this task. It is not sexy or super exciting but it is extremely important if you want to more phone calls and foot traffic from local searches. Why not do it right the first time?

Local search is a lead generation strategy aimed at increasing foot traffic and phone calls to a physical location. You don't win at local search unless you are moving lots of data quickly. To do so you must know the ins and outs of the local search ecosystem. We’ve built the best platform and tools that help us quickly improve your location visibility. Now don't get us wrong, local search also works for service area businesses too! If you service a local market or want to rank your brand for organic searches you need accurate, consistent, and complete local business listings.

The most important steps in local search listing management is to gather all the assets and business details needed to build a complete location master profile to submit. Once we have all the details we begin processing your Data Aggregator submissions and then advance on to the top 50+ websites being manually claimed, submit to direct API feed providers, and then our focus is on claiming and submitting additional listings as they are created or discovered by our software.
