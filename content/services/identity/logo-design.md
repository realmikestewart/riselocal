When Rise Local creates a new logo or recreate your exisitng logo you know the job will be done right. You may even get more than you expect.
<!--more-->

Most designers hold on to the master file so you have to go through them any time you need a new version. That is definately not the Rise Local way.

Not only do we give you the master file, but we will deliver it along with all the logo versions, letterhead layouts, business card layouts, and website icons you will probably ever need. Best of all, you never have to worry about keeping track of your logo files because we archive the files for in a place you can access the files anytime you need them. Need that logo in a new format? No problem, we will produce it for you absolutely free!

## Here is What You Get
-   A New Logo or Your Existing Logo professionally produced in a master file format.
-   An SVG logo for your website.
-   Optimized PNGs and JPGs for Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Yelp, Quickbooks and MORE!
-   Black and White version for all your JPGs and PNGs
-   Favicon for optimized for the last three versions of IE, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and more.

## What's the Process?
For new designs we ask you few questions about your logo preferences. We compile that into a creative brief and send it to our designer. A day or two later we forward to you our best idea. We collect you feedback and render a final draft for you approve. Once approved we build the master file.

Existing design is even more straight forward. You simply give us your current file and we turn it over to our expert graphic designer to work his magic.

## What about Revisions?
Unlimited. It's unlimited because most of our clients trust us to produce a great looking logo that is appropriate for thier business. If you prefer more creative control our brand identity service may be a better fit.

## Timeline
We can typically get the first design interation to you in 48 to 78 hours. Once you approve a final draft we need another day or two to build the master file and render the additional formats. When that is all done we will send you an notification that logo is finished with a direct download links to retrieve your files.

## Costs
We collect a flat fee of $500 to cover the cost of design consulting, unlimited revisions, producing the final deliverables, and lifetime version updates. Lifetime versions support means that if you ever need us to produce the same logo in new format we do it for free. The only additional charge is archival storage. It's $10 per year after that.
