The Rise Local story began in 2009 when, Mike Stewart and John O'Grady decided to do something never heard of in the local media company - tell customers the truth.

As you can imagine, "The Man" didn't really appreciate the guys sticking it to him.

Everyone responds to getting fired differently. Mike's starting a highly respected digital media company that developed a reputation for delivering great business results. John ran off to Thailand to build stuff.

By 2013 John ran out of money and gave Mike a call. The two agreed to meet in Kansas City at a tech incubator called Home for Hackers to exchange ideas on ways to help local service businesses and professional service organization eliminate wasteful spending and generate more phone calls and leads off their websites.

Over the course of a cold winter weekend it became apparent to Mike and John that between them they had the core components needed to deliver high-end IT Services, Website Support, and Marketing Services efficiently, effectively, and at low cost.
