We believe marketing is a process. That's why we get things done faster at lower costs.

<!--more-->
What attracts most marketers to the profession is the "ideas" or "creative" side of discipline. When you realize your marketing staff and local marketing agency are engaged in an intellectual pursuit you begin to understand why they are big on talk and short on results.

"Hey, I'm just the idea guy! We don't actually work", is the attitude that is costing you a fortune and has you spinning your wheels!

Rise Local is not an agency. We are an IT services and Marketing operations company. That means our focus is doing work.

The truth is local business owners understand their value proposition better than a marketing person ever could. What they really need are knowledgable people doing the things that have to be done.

-   Social media profiles have to be regularly updated
-   Local Listings have to be claimed and verified.
-   WordPress has to be maintained.
-   Leads have to be captured, counted and distributed to the right people

These are just a few of the hundreds of tasks that have to be completed, monitored and maintained on a ongoing basis. What good is a marketing person who tells you what you need to do if you do not have the capacity to get it done?

Getting things done is, at its core, is why local small business owners trust Rise Local.

In short, Chomp, Chomp, Chomp instead of Blah, Blah, Blah has a more positive impact on your business.
