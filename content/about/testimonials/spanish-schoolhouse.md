Rise Local works with us to meet our needs, within our budget, for a Local Listing campaign for all of our locations. The monthly reporting is detailed, and they work with each location to improve results each month. They provide additional marketing support and advice as an "add-on" service, and are always willing to answer any questions, provide guidance throughout the process.  I feel that they are truly invested in the growth of our business.
